## Methodology
1. Data Cleaning
    - The dataset was cleaned to address missing values and inconsistencies in data types.
    - Non-numeric columns were prepared for analysis through appropriate encoding.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    - Visualizations and statistical analysis were conducted to explore relationships between different variables and car prices.
    - Key features such as vehicle age, mileage, brand, and fuel type were analyzed to understand their impact on pricing.
3. Data Visualization
    - Various graphs and charts were created to provide insights into trends and patterns in the Australian car market.
    - Visualizations include:
        - Distribution of car prices by brand and model.
        - Relationship between mileage and price.
        - Price trends for new vs. used cars.
        - Distribution of car prices across different fuel types and engine capacities.
## Results
Through the data analysis and visualizations, several key insights were discovered:
- Brand Influence: Certain car brands, such as luxury brands, tend to command higher prices.
- Vehicle Condition: Newer cars and cars with lower mileage are priced significantly higher than older or high-mileage vehicles.
- Fuel Type: Cars with fuel-efficient or hybrid engines tend to have higher price points in the market.
- Location: Car prices vary by location, with urban centers typically commanding higher prices.
These insights can guide industry stakeholders in setting appropriate pricing strategies and understanding the competitive landscape in the Australian car market.
